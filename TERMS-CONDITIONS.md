# Terms and Conditions

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you
should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. DeathGuy
is a free and open source app released under the permissive MIT license.

amdotblacksheep is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
possible. For that reason, amdotblacksheep reserves the right to make changes to the app
or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. amdotblacksheep will never
charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
you’re paying for.

DeathGuy app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
amdotblacksheep, in order to provide this Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
phone and access to the app secure. amdotblacksheep therefore recommends that you do
not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
phone’s security features and it could mean that the DeathGuy app won’t work properly
or at all.

The app does use third-party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

  * [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
  * [AdMob](https://developers.google.com/admob/terms)
  * [Godot](https://godotengine.org/license)

You should be aware that there are some things that amdotblacksheep will not take
responsibility for. Some functions of the app require an active internet connection. The
connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but
amdotblacksheep cannot take responsibility if you don't have access to Wi-Fi or if you
run out of mobile data and the app doesn't work.

If you’re using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, you should remember that your terms of
the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
be charged by your mobile network provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re
accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use
the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
please be aware that amdotblacksheep assumes that you have received permission from
the bill payer to use the app.

Along the same lines, amdotblacksheep cannot take responsibility for the way you use
the app (i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, amdotblacksheep cannot accept
responsibility).

With respect to amdotblacksheep’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re
using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although amdotblacksheep endeavours
to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, amdotblacksheep relies on third
parties to provide information so that amdotblacksheep can make it available to you.
amdotblacksheep accepts no liability for any direct or indirect loss you experience as a
result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, amdotblacksheep may wish to update the app. The app is currently
available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems
amdotblacksheep decides to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll
need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. amdotblacksheep does
not promise that the app will always be updated so that it works with the Android
version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
updates to the application when offered to you, amdotblacksheep may also wish to stop
providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
termination to you. Unless amdotblacksheep tells you otherwise, upon any termination,
(a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using
the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
